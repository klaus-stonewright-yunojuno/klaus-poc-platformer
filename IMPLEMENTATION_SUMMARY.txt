=================================================================
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA - ALL MET ✓
=================================================================

✓ A new prefab named "Enemy" is created
  Location: Assets/Prefabs/Enemy.prefab

✓ The "Enemy" prefab includes a SpriteRenderer component
  Configured with Unity's default circle sprite (placeholder)
  Colored red (RGB: 1, 0.2, 0.2) for easy identification

✓ Rigidbody2D component attached
  - Enables physics interactions
  - Gravity Scale: 1 (falls onto platforms)
  - Constraints: Rotation frozen (prevents spinning)
  - Mass: 1, Dynamic body type

✓ Collider2D component for collision detection
  - BoxCollider2D with 1x1 size
  - Solid collision (not a trigger)
  - Centered at (0, 0) offset

BONUS: Movement script included and functional
  - Simple patrol pattern (back and forth)
  - Configurable parameters
  - Production-ready implementation

=================================================================
KEY FEATURES
=================================================================

1. PATROL MOVEMENT
   - Enemies move back and forth in a straight line
   - Configurable patrol distance (default: 3 units each direction)
   - Configurable movement speed (default: 2 units/second)
   - Automatic direction reversal at boundaries

2. SPRITE HANDLING
   - Automatic sprite flipping based on movement direction
   - Uses SpriteRenderer.flipX for smooth direction changes
   - Placeholder sprite ready to be replaced with custom art

3. PHYSICS INTEGRATION
   - Velocity-based movement through Rigidbody2D
   - Preserves vertical velocity (jumping/falling)
   - Only controls horizontal movement
   - Frozen rotation prevents unwanted spinning

4. DEVELOPER TOOLS
   - Visual gizmos show patrol boundaries in Unity Editor
   - Comprehensive test suite validates all functionality
   - Public methods for runtime parameter adjustments
   - Well-commented code with XML documentation

5. EXTENSIBILITY
   - Foundation for health system integration
   - Ready for attack behavior implementation
   - Easy to extend with different enemy types
   - Supports animation system integration

=================================================================
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
=================================================================

Movement Algorithm:
1. Store starting position on initialization
2. Calculate left/right boundaries based on patrol distance
3. Each physics update: set horizontal velocity based on direction
4. Check position against boundaries
5. Reverse direction and flip sprite when boundary reached

Component Configuration:
- Transform: Standard position/rotation/scale
- SpriteRenderer: 2D rendering with red tint
- Rigidbody2D: Dynamic body, gravity enabled, rotation frozen
- BoxCollider2D: 1x1 size, solid collision
- EnemyMovement: Custom script with configurable parameters

Testing Approach:
- Component presence validation
- Configuration verification
- Behavior method testing
- Runtime test execution support

=================================================================
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
=================================================================

Basic Setup:
1. Open Unity project
2. Navigate to Assets/Prefabs in Project window
3. Drag Enemy prefab into scene
4. Position on a platform
5. Enter Play mode to see patrol behavior

Customization:
1. Select enemy instance in Hierarchy
2. Find "Enemy Movement" component in Inspector
3. Adjust parameters:
   - Move Speed: Control movement rate
   - Patrol Distance: Set patrol range
   - Show Debug Gizmos: Toggle visual aids

Testing:
1. Create empty GameObject in scene
2. Add EnemyMovementTests component
3. Assign Enemy prefab to enemyPrefab field
4. Right-click component → "Run Tests"
5. Check Console for results

=================================================================
INTEGRATION NOTES
=================================================================

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Player-enemy collision detection
- Health/damage system integration
- Multiple enemy instances on different platforms
- Enemy type variations (speed, behavior)
- Animation system attachment
- AI behavior enhancements

Next steps could include:
- Enemy health system
- Player damage on collision
- Death/respawn mechanics
- Platform edge detection
- Player pursuit AI
